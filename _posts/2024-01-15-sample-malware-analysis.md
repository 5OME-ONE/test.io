## Initial Triage

The sample was first discovered through our honeypot network on January 12, 2024. Initial static analysis revealed several interesting characteristics:

```python
import pefile

pe = pefile.PE('sample.exe')

# Check for suspicious sections
for section in pe.sections:
    print(f"Section: {section.Name.decode()}")
    print(f"Virtual Address: {hex(section.VirtualAddress)}")
    print(f"Entropy: {section.get_entropy()}")
